#!/usr/bin/env bash
# kreuzcrawl MCP launcher — locates or installs a working kreuzcrawl binary,
# then exec's it with the forwarded arguments (the plugin passes `mcp`).
#
# Why this exists: the plugin ships manifests + scripts, not a compiled binary.
# Rather than require users to install kreuzcrawl first, this launcher finds or
# installs one on first run, preferring tools the user likely already has. Every
# step FALLS THROUGH to the next on any failure, so the launcher self-heals as
# more distribution channels come online.
#
# Resolution order (override with KREUZCRAWL_LAUNCHER=auto|npx|uvx|brew|download):
#
#   a) An existing kreuzcrawl binary (cached in the plugin's bin/, or on PATH
#      from a prior brew install) — any working binary is accepted; there is no
#      strict version match, because the plugin version and the upstream CLI
#      version are decoupled.
#   b) npx: probe the published npm package, and if it exposes the CLI, run it.
#   c) uvx: probe the published PyPI package, and if it exposes the CLI, run it.
#   d) brew install xberg-io/tap/kreuzcrawl, then exec the on-PATH binary.
#   e) Direct download of the prebuilt CLI archive from the GitHub *latest*
#      release. The current latest release ships NO CLI asset, so this 404s and
#      falls through; it self-heals once a CLI archive is attached.
#   f) Give up with guidance (brew tap, or `cargo install --git` from source
#      with `--features all`).
#
# `auto` tries every step in order; an explicit value pins that single channel
# (each still first honors an already-present binary in step (a)).
#
# The kreuzcrawl CLI crate is NOT published to crates.io, so `cargo install
# kreuzcrawl-cli` (registry form) does not work and is intentionally absent. The
# only cargo path that works is `cargo install --git`, which compiles from the
# repo — see the final guidance below. The CLI's `mcp` subcommand lives behind
# a non-default feature, so the from-source command uses `--features all`.
#
# Note on npx/uvx: the kreuzcrawl npm and PyPI CLI packages are being rolled out
# (the package self-installs/runs the binary, basemind-style). They may not be
# published yet, so each is PROBED first and falls through cleanly if absent.
# The `@kreuzberg/kreuzcrawl` npm package and the importable pip package are
# language SDKs/bindings, NOT the CLI — they are not used here.
#
# CRITICAL: stdout is the MCP stdio protocol channel. Every diagnostic in this
# script MUST go to stderr (>&2). Only the exec'd binary may write to stdout.
