# kreuzberg-cloud

Managed Kreuzberg document intelligence on `api.xberg.io` from Gemini CLI
sessions. The cloud surface accepts PDFs, Office docs, images, and URL crawls;
returns text, tables, metadata, and images; supports webhook delivery,
presigned uploads for large files, document versioning and diffing, sandbox
keys, and per-project usage tracking.

## v0.1.0 limitation

This release is documentation-only — seven skills covering the API surface and
no MCP server. The `kreuzberg-cloud` CLI binary lands in plugin v0.2.0 and
will be auto-registered as an MCP server at that point. Until then, call the
HTTP API directly (curl) or use the official TypeScript / Python SDKs.

## Authentication

Every request needs a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://api.xberg.io/v1/usage \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KREUZBERG_API_KEY"
```

Provision the key one of two ways:

1. Export `KREUZBERG_API_KEY` in your shell or session.
2. Write `~/.kreuzberg/cloud.toml` with `api_key = "sk_live_..."`.

The plugin's `SessionStart` hook checks both on every session and emits a
setup reminder if neither is configured. Sandbox keys (24h, 50-page quota,
no signup) can be minted via `POST /v1/sandbox/key` — see the `sandbox-keys`
skill.

## Skills shipped

- `kreuzberg-cloud` — full API surface, when to prefer cloud over local.
- `offloading-extraction` — submitting jobs via `POST /v1/extract`.
- `tracking-cloud-jobs` — polling `GET /v1/jobs/{id}` and webhook delivery.
- `versioning-documents` — `GET /v1/documents/{id}`, version history, and diffs.
- `presigned-uploads` — three-step flow for files larger than ~50 MB.
- `managing-cloud-usage` — quota and billing visibility via `GET /v1/usage`.
- `sandbox-keys` — minting ephemeral keys for evaluation.

## Working with the user

State the exact endpoint and payload before issuing the request. Quote
filenames and job IDs. Prefer presigned uploads for anything over 50 MB —
the JSON `data` field is base64 and inflates large bodies. When extraction
is queued, ask whether to poll or rely on the user's webhook.

For installation across hosts (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, opencode,
